Preliminary study for the SessionManager

## Setup
Use the Linux VM stored in the NAS (link to provide).

Use VSCode IDE to leverage the configuration files and utilities provided in the .vscode folder.

To compile and run SessionManager:
- `xmake run session_manager` -> build (if necessary) then run target
OR
- Use one of the targets in the `Run And Debug` VS Code tab and click on the green arrow

To compile only:
- `xmake build`

To switch release/debug configuration (release by default):
- `xmake f -m debug`
- `xmake f -m release`

To launch unit tests: 
- `xmake test`
